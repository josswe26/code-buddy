# Code Buddy


![Code Buddy mockup images](assets/readme_files/mockup_image.jpg)


Code Buddy is a website created to allow developers to ask questions and receive relevant answers from other developers.

The main objective of the site is to allow developers to share knowledge and ideas, collaborate and help each other to find solutions to the problems they face. This is achieved by providing a platform of questions and answers, where users can search for the information they are looking for. Developers are also able to upvote or downvote the questions and answers in order to assure that relevant content gets highlighted.

Visit the deployed website [here](https://django-code-buddy.herokuapp.com/).

### Surface

#### Color Scheme

![Color scheme image](assets/readme_files/color_scheme.png)

The colors used in the website are a teal blue color (#3F778D) for secondary buttons, navbar links, as well as for main buttons and links transitions. Charcoal (#253A47) is used for the main text, footer background, main buttons and secondary buttons and links transitions.

A platinum (#E9EDE9) for the navigation bar and card footers background, footer and buttons content. A baby powder color (#FFFFFD) is also used in the main background and cards footer as well as for input fields.

The colors are were chosen keeping in mind simplicity but also providing the website a modern design. This in order to keep the focus on the content but also appealing for the users.


#### Typography

The main font being used in the site is Nunito, with sans-serif as a fallback in case Nunito doesn't get imported correctly. Roboto, with sans-serif as a fallback is used mainly for headings and the logo has been given the Quicksand font, with sans-serif as a fallback.

Nunito and Roboto were chosen after some research on fonts that are better for reading. Specially Nunito which has been used as main font. Quicksand was used for the logo for design purposes.

### Code Validation

#### HTML

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) service was used to validate the HTML code of the project in order to ensure there were no syntax errors.
 
W3C Markup Validator found the following errors concerning index.html.

![index.html validation errors image](assets/testing_files/index_validation_errors.jpg)

The errors were solved by removing the aria-label attribute from the nav, as well as removing the invalid closing Div tag.

![index.html validation](assets/testing_files/index_validation.jpg)



W3C Markup Validator also found a great amount of errors in pages with user input. However I found those errors to be coming from the Summernote editor. See example below:

![Summernote HTML errors image](assets/testing_files/summernote_errors.jpg)


##### CSS

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) service was used to validate the CSS code of the project in order to ensure there were no syntax errors. 

W3C CSS Validator found no errors or warnings on my CSS.

![CSS validation image](assets/testing_files/css_validation.png)


#### Pyhton

Pylint was used continuously during the development process to analyze the Python code for programming errors.

[PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) was further used to validate the Python code to validate the Python code for PEP8 requirements. See below the validation results and the reviewed results.
